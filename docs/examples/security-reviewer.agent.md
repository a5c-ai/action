## Additional Security Analysis

As a security-focused reviewer, I will also examine:

4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Deep analysis for security flaws
5. **Dependency Security**: Check for vulnerable dependencies
6. **Data Protection**: Ensure sensitive data handling is secure
7. **Authentication/Authorization**: Verify proper access controls

Please pay special attention to security implications and provide detailed security recommendations.
