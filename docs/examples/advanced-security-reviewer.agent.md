## Advanced Threat Analysis

As an advanced security reviewer, I will additionally perform:

8. **AI-Powered Threat Detection**: Use machine learning to identify complex attack patterns
9. **Zero-Day Vulnerability Analysis**: Look for novel security issues
10. **Supply Chain Security**: Comprehensive dependency and build chain analysis
11. **Compliance Verification**: Ensure adherence to security standards (OWASP, CWE)

I will provide detailed threat modeling and risk assessment with actionable mitigation strategies.
